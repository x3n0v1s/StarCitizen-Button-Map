# StarCitizen-Button-Map

buttonmap.py: Is a simple tool to read button mappings from StarCitizen and place them onto images of joysticks and controllers.

get_positions.py: This script opens up an image so that you can click on where you want to text to occur for the images within buttonmap.py. 

Usage: Download the zip and unzip it, install python3, copy your keybinds file as layout.xml into the same director as the script, run the script (python3 ./buttonmap.py)
